git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/product-catalog-app.git](https://github.com/yourusername/product-catalog-app.git)

### Environment Variables Setup

Before running the backend, you need to create `.env` files based on the `.env.template` files in the following locations:

1. **Root Directory (`./`)**: For MongoDB credentials.

2. **`./services/product/`**: For product service configuration.

**Root Directory (`.env`)**:

```
# mongo
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=xxx
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=xxx
MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=xxx

```

**Product Service Directory (`./services/product/.env`)**:

```
PORT=xxx
IS_DOCKERIZED=xxx
LOCAL_MONGO_URI=xxx
DOCKERIZED_MONGO_URI=xxx
ENABLE_CORS=[can be left blank]
CLIENT_IP=[can be left blank]
REDIS_HOST=xxx
REDIS_PORT=xxx

```
